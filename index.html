    <p>The basics of coding is simple to understand but for things like making a sentence or anyother basic part of code it must begin with</p>
    <p>you can put sentences in bold, italic, or mix of both</p>
    <p>for making a header you can use h1-5 1 being the biggest and 5 being the smallest</p>
    <p>for example</p>
    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <p>h0 and anything bigger than h5 does not work or simple does not exist</p>
    <p>also with code if you don't type the code right you will know because no changes will be made or if you use something like Text for chromebooks rest bits of code will be red</p>
