<p>To link a page to another the file name must be correct to be linked and must match the file name exactily otherwise it won't work</p>
    <p>plus for the background color you can either go to a website or just type bgcolor="color"</p>
    <p>also if you need more help with code i would suggest www.w3schools.com or www.codecademy.com</p>
    <p>to make a website live i would suggest www.github.com but for github you can only make a personal website because github doesn't have any servers you can use for people to login/register or search stuff but if you want to make a website that people can search stuff or login/register i would recommend awardspace.com</p>
    <p>but those two are my personal opinion you don't have to use them if you can find a better one then use what ever you wish im not telling you what website coder you should use</p>
    <p>but with github i would suggest you create a readme file
